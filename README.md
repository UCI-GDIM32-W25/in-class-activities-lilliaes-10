# GDIM32 In Class Activities

# W1

### Activity 1

To ace the class, my tablemates discussed that we should attend LA hours and actively search online for answers to code issues or for coding specific things tutorials.

### Activity 2

1: 10

2: 2

3: write "hello world" to the console every frane.

4: MonoBehaviour

5: Print "x=10" to the Console upon game load.

6: Method argument and method parameter, which are used to pass input data to a method.

7: You can't move the transform class, you can only move the specific object.

8: It should be changed to "_playerTransform" instead of "Transform".

In today's class I worked on MG2 by adding the background, ground, player, and coin sprites. I also set up the coin prefab and coded the player to jump on the space key and also not double jump.

### Activity 1

The locator objects are present logically, but not visibally in the game. This is because they are editor helpers and not a visual component.

[MG4 Initial Commit](https://github.com/lilliaes-10/HW4/commit/e7af8ff7c60aaf4345560721bb39c7af1caa8283)
In class, I set up the background, vertical camera, ground, and player. I learned to download and upload and splice sprite sheets.

### Activity 1

I think using abstract Item class with the IBreakable interface makes sense for a game with different kinds of usable items. The Item abstract class works as a shared base that makes all items implement the Use() method, keeping code organized for handling different items in an inventory. The IBreakable interface is helpful for separating durability behavior from item behavior. If I were building a project, I would keep the design the same but maybe move durability logic into a shared class to avoid repeating similar code in each breakable item.

### Activity 2

The model in the W5demo2 are the scriptable objects EnemyStats and ItemW5Demo2, which are used in the enemy and player script to show the internal stat of the enemy and also the items in the player's inventory. The controller in the demo is the Player script, which detects input and moves the player based on the input received. The view is the dialogue UI and inventory UI.

### Activity 3

Scenario 1: Model View Controller with C# events
Scenario 2: Scriptable objects for weapons and abilities, inheritance for weapon abstract class, model view controller with C# events for the gunshots coming in contact with enemy. Finite state machine for animations and movements.
Scenario 3: Scriptable objects for the plants and rocks. Model view controller for the player to receive input and react to the movement input. Model for the data of the game.

### Activity 4

Attendance: Leandro, Lillian
